## Overview and Origin

 ![Sidewalk Labs Logo](./Resources/logo_sidewalk_full_076263f719.svg)

* Sidewalk Labs (Alphabet)<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup>

* Founded June 2015<sup>[[2]](#2)</sup>

* __Sidewalk Labs__ was founded within __Google__ in 2015 before it moved under
the __Alpahabet__ parent company.

* __Sidewalk Labs__ has only held one round funding which has received a total of
five million dollars<sup>[[3.1]](#3)</sup>

## Business Activities

* __Sidewalk Labs__ mission is to reduce climate change and it's affects by
supporting urban development with AI and technology. As put on their website,

```text
Sidewalk Labs' mission is to radically improve quality of life in cities for all.
We were founded in 2015 on the principle of bringing urbanists and technologists
together to create a climate-positive future.
...
If you are in real estate or work for a city, we'd like to speak with you.
```

* The primary customers for __Sidewalk Labs__ are realestate development companies
and policy makers who can affect urban planning.Their major products include:
  * Mesa: a product to `reduce carbon emissions, [recently] added leak detection
  and air quality monitoring`<sup>[[5]](#5)</sup>. *_This product is no longer
  listed on their home web page._

  * Delve: `helps real estate teams and cities create and compare thousands of
  design options for a city block or neighborhood.`<sup>[[5]](#5)</sup>

  * Pebble: `helps cities and developers understand where parking is needed and
  when to reduce the number of total spaces needed.`<sup>[[5]](#5)</sup> *_This product is no longer listed on
  their home web page._

* Since __Sidewalk Labs__ is a subsidiary of __Alphabet__ you can not calculate
their market cap on the stock exchange, however __Alpahabet__'s is $1.854
Trillion<sup>[[4]](#4)</sup>. However, I feel the more interesting question--which
I'm unable to finde the answer for--is how many major cities are using
__Sidewalk Labs__' services and how can the out reach to more municipalities.  
One of __Sidewalk Labs__' more public partnerships is with _Toronto, CA_;
proposing a 1.3 billion dollar price with `the hopes of catalyzing $38 billion
in investments by 2040`<sup>[[6]](#6)</sup>. This plan has since been canceled.
<sup>[[14]](#14)</sup>

* One advantage __Sidewalk Labs__ has right from the starting line is being
associated with Google/Alphabet. This gives them a big financial headstart,
access to Google's resources such as privlaged access to their AI modling, mapping
and location data, and most importantly, their reputation.

* I will only delve into Delve here, since I'm unable to get primary sources for
Mesa and Pebble at the moment. `Delve uses generative design and AI to reveal
the very best options for your project priorities.`

## Landscape

* Almost all of the major tech companies have attempted to make smart cities a
reality, including Cisco Systems, IBM, and Microsoft; however I feel that sidewalk
labs top competor in the space currently is going to come from startups like
UrbanistAI.

* Most of the companies I see when searching for __Sidewalk Labs__'  competitors
tend to be people focusing on the data collection side, very few are using
AI to help design our cities. This is why I feel __Sidewalk Labs__ really stands
out and is one of the more successful smart city projects. The primary AI urban
design tool I found outside of __Sidewalk labs__ is __UrbanistAI__<sup>[[12]](12)
</sup>--a company that seems to be taking photos of existing infrastructure and
using using image generation similar to photoshops new auto fill feature.
__Sidewalk Labs__ seems to be the only one developing actual plans when designing
a city.

## Results

* So far __Sidewalk Labs__' flagship project seems to be the collaboration
between them and the city of Toronto CA, where __Sidewalk Labs__ has design a 12
acre lot<sup>[[13]](#13)</sup>, using sustainable materials. However, this
project was scrapped by May 2020<sup>[[14]](#14)</sup>.

* If success is defiend by being the first to implement a smart city so far I see
no company that has truely succeeded yet. I feel that __Sidewalk Labs__ has come
really close, only having their proposal revoked after the 2020 pandemic caused
major uncertainty. In the mean time __Sidewalk Labs__ is still selling a
partnering with realestate development teams.

## Recommendations

* I would suggest tracking decibel level and how changes to the infrastruct would
affect the volume of the surrounding area.

  * It is increasingly evedent that increased noise polution is leading to medical
  side affects that are becoming more understood, including, `heart disease, high
  blood pressure, and stroke`<sup>[[7](#7)]</sup>  
  ![alt text](image-1.png)<sup>[[8](#8)]</sup>

  * This would likely require on the ground sound recording equipment to measure
  the volume before and after which will have an increased burden placed on the
  developers/policy makers in addition to the cost of the equipment.

  * This change might be nessicary to operate in some countries as Nuicense laws
  are passed limiting the average noise level housing can be subjected to. In the
  Netherlands they have already passed such laws. `Near buildings, the noise from
  road traffic, businesses and other sources may not normally exceed certain
  levels, or ‘preferred limit values’.`<sup>[[9]](#9)</sup> Additionally the cost
  of equipment may not even be that high once you realize everyone is carrying a
  sound recording device on them these days. Google has even devloped an app
  called Science Journal (now Arduino Science Journal), which has the ability to
  track decible over a duration. So they would need to update the software to
  take this data in and model projected noise levels once the changes are done

* There is also a concern about a lack of domocrization within the process and
public perception issues with clames that `it sought to establish an autonomous
city zone excluded from democratic oversight and governed by itself as the “lead
developer of real estate.”`<sup>[[10](#10)]</sup> To combat these worries and
allegations I suggest that they include the local officials more closely during
the design phase of the project and if any regulations seem antiquated or extra
burdensom propose having the population vote on over turning or amending rather
than seeking blaket exemptions. Finally I would suggest having an method for
residents to submit feedback and commentary during the process, this could look
like having a message board that is shared via ads using location service, qr
codes around the city, or just mailing the info to the local residents.

  * I mentioned before that __Sidewalk Labs__ has the reputation of its parent
  company, __Alphabet__, that can be a mixed blessing as everyone knows them but
  also __Google__ has been on the end of many controversial lawsuits recently
  that may lead to some level of mistrust from the public. So implementing my
  proposals and going above and beyond for public out reach is essential.

  * There is no special technology required for these other than graphic design
  work to best attract the eye of the locals and communicating with residents and
  officials.

  * It was just 100 years ago since the decline of company towns in America
  <sup>[[11](#11)]</sup> and I have seen more conversation around it since Apple
  and Google have started building campuses that their employees never have to
  leave. Developing a city that you are able to go around the regulations that
  other developers may not be able to will be unsettling to people. You will need
  to gain public favor with this new technology before people are willing to
  accept much of what is being offered.
