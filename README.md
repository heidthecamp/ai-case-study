## Overview and Origin

 ![Sidewalk Labs Logo](./Resources/logo_sidewalk_full_076263f719.svg)

* Sidewalk Labs (Alphabet)<sup>[[1]](#1)</sup>

* Founded June 2015<sup>[[2]](#2)</sup>

* __Sidewalk Labs__ was founded within __Google__ in 2015 before it moved under
the __Alpahabet__ parent company.

* __Sidewalk Labs__ has only held one round funding which has received a total of
five million dollars<sup>[[3.1]](#3)</sup>

## Business Activities

* __Sidewalk Labs__ mission is to reduce climate change and it's affects by
supporting urban development with AI and technology. As put on their website,

```text
Sidewalk Labs' mission is to radically improve quality of life in cities for all.
We were founded in 2015 on the principle of bringing urbanists and technologists
together to create a climate-positive future.
...
If you are in real estate or work for a city, we'd like to speak with you.
```

* The primary customers for __Sidewalk Labs__ are realestate development companies
and policy makers who can affect urban planning.Their major products include:
  * Mesa: a product to `reduce carbon emissions, [recently] added leak detection and air 
  quality monitoring`<sup>[[5]](#5)</sup>. *_This product is no longer listed on
  their home web page._

  * Delve: `helps real estate teams and cities create and compare thousands of
  design options for a city block or neighborhood.`<sup>[[5]](#5)</sup>

  * Pebble: `helps cities and developers understand where parking is needed and
  when to reduce the number of total spaces needed.`<sup>[[5]](#5)</sup> *_This product is no longer listed on
  their home web page._

* Since __Sidewalk Labs__ is a subsidiary of __Alphabet__ you can not calculate
their market cap on the stock exchange, however __Alpahabet__'s is $1.854
Trillion<sup>[[4]](#4)</sup>. However, I feel the more interesting question--which
I'm unable to finde the answer for--is how many major cities are using
__Sidewalk Labs__' services and how can the out reach to more municipalities.  
One of __Sidewalk Labs__' more public partnerships is with _Toronto, CA_;
proposing a 1.3 billion dollar price with `the hopes of catalyzing $38 billion
in investments by 2040`<sup>[[6]](#6)</sup>

* One advantage __Sidewalk Labs__ has right from the starting line is being
associated with Google/Alphabet. This gives them a big financial headstart,
access to Google's resources such as privlaged access to their AI modling, mapping
and location data, and most importantly, their reputation.

* I will only delve into Delve here, since I'm unable to get primary sources for
Mesa and Pebble at the moment. `Delve uses generative design and AI to reveal
the very best options for your project priorities.`
